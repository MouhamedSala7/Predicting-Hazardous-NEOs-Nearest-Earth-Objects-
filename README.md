# Predicting Hazardous NEOs (Nearest Earth Objects)
### Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether a Nearest Earth Object (NEO) is hazardous. The dataset used for this project consists of over 338,000 records collected by NASA, spanning from 1910 to 2024. Accurate prediction of hazardous NEOs is crucial for planetary defense and could play a vital role in preventing potential impacts.

### Project Structure
- Data Importing and Cleaning:  
         -- Addressed missing values and ensured the dataset is clean for reliable model training.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
         --Visualized data trends and patterns using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
         -- correlations and potential features relevant to predicting hazardous NEOs.
- Data Preprocessing:
  --Performed feature selection and encoding of categorical variables.
  --Normalized and scaled numerical features.
  --Addressed class imbalance in the "is_hazardous" target variable using techniques such as SMOTE and undersampling.
- Model Training and Evaluation:
 --Trained multiple machine learning models including [insert model names].
--Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC Curve.
--Selected the best-performing model based on balanced accuracy.
